# New Project

yarn install

## Available Scripts

### yarn start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### yarn test

Run jest component unit tests.

### yarn run build

Builds the app for production to the `build/` folder.
It correctly bundles Vue in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.
