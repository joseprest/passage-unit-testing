# New Project

yarn install

## Available Scripts

### yarn start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### yarn test

Run jest component unit tests.

### yarn run build

Builds the app for production to the `build/` folder.
It correctly bundles Vue in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### yarn storybook

For Vue component development outside of the entire full-stack app.

Create a story for each component that is being worked on. And some stories can be used for multi-component testing.

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.

Here's a sample problem I'm working on you could give some input on.
- Requirement:
- As a test creator, I would like to create a reference to a highlighted part of the reading passage.
- The reading passage is a text that students read and later answer questions on.
- For example the reading passage would be on the left and the line reference would be in the question on the right side.
- Example from the Student/Test Taker point of view:
- highlight + lines show the relationship between the ReadingPassageReference component in the Question
- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmy-testing%2Fm9CSoXpVDH.png?alt=media&token=078dae69-ccaa-45c1-b53a-a652dbb6857f)
- The linked page reference would be updated if the width of the content div is updated so the line numbers would line up.
- When editing the question using TinyMCE the user would like to be able to click the "Create Passage Reference" button (implemented as a TinyMCE plugin) to insert a page reference to the currently highlighted text. If the text was not already highlighted, alert the user to try again with selected text.
- For Discussion
- What approach would you use to communicate between the different components involved?
- What kinds of challenges, approaches or alternatives would you recommend?
- How much effort is required to implement this? What parts would take the longest




Reading Passage

"Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don't tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist--I really believe he is Antichrist--I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my 'faithful slave,' as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened you--sit down and tell me all the news."

HOW Does the Question communicate with the ReadingPassage

Hard code the content Ids - limitation is we can only have one ReadingPassage and one Question per screen.
Vue Inject the ReadingPassage context

User creates a question in TinyMCE. TinyMCE works with plain HTML. TinyMCE has a button called “Create Reading Passage Reference”. Generates simple html for a line reference like:  <a data-line-ref=“”/>


Question
	render() =>
		get the HTML of the default slot
		replace the querySelectorAll(‘a[data-line-ref]’) with Vue components for <LineReference refId=“”>

restrictions or goals:
the line number should be dynamic based on the end-users screen height and width (of text)

store the reference to the reference in the database

TODO:

implement the <ReadingPassageProvider> </ReadingPassageProvider>, move from App.vue
check the terminology for Vue-ness?
example or reference to official Vue naming recommendations for provide/inject container

needs to work with TinyMCE <a id=“xcbxcbxcb”/>  or web component

OR: create a custom plugin
